# STIM 

STIM provides a comprehensive computational pipeline for the integration and analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. This tool is designed to integrate tissue histology with both high-definition spatial transcriptomics (e.g., Xenium) and transcriptome-wide spatial transcriptomics (e.g., Visium). STIM enables: 
- Mapping gene expression across different spatial transcriptomics platforms
- Analyzing cell neighborhoods to identify spatial patterns and interactions
- Inferring ligand-receptor interactions

### Installation
`pip install pySTIM` 

### Import
`import pySTIM as pst`

### Usage
Please look at our [documentation](https://stim-tutorial.readthedocs.io/) with example usage.
