STIM: Spatial multimodal Transcriptome Integration and Mapping
==============================================================

This package provides a comprehensive toolkit for integrating and analyzing spatial transcriptomics data. \
It is specifically designed to combine imaging-based Xenium next-generation sequencing, Visium spatial transcriptomics technologies, \
and detailed histological analysis. STIM enhances the mapping of gene expression, cell types, and neighborhoods, \
facilitating investigations into cell-type composition, cell-cell interaction, and molecular interactions within the tissue micronevironment.
